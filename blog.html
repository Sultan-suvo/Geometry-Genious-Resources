    <h1>1) What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
    <p>Ans : The Document Object Model, or DOM, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so
        that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes
        and objects, allowing programming languages like JavaScript to access and manipulate the document's content,
        structure, and style.

        The purpose of the DOM is to provide a platform- and language-neutral way that allows programs and scripts to
        dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of web documents. This means that a web page can
        be modified and updated dynamically without the need to reload the page. For example, using the DOM, JavaScript
        can dynamically change the text and images on a web page, create new HTML elements, and respond to user events
        such as clicks and form submissions.</p>

    <h1>২) How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods</h1>

    <p>Answer : To select HTML elements using the DOM, you can use various methods to locate and access elements based
        on their properties, attributes, or position within the document. Here are some common methods to select HTML
        elements using the DOM:

        getElementById(): This method selects an element by its unique id attribute value.

        Example:

        javascript

        var elem = document.getElementById("myElement");

        getElementsByClassName(): This method selects elements by their class attribute value.

        Example:

        javascript

        var elems = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

        getElementsByTagName(): This method selects elements by their tag name.

        Example:

        var elems = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

        querySelector(): This method selects the first element that matches a given CSS selector.

        Example:



        var elem = document.querySelector("#myElement .myClass");

        querySelectorAll(): This method selects all elements that match a given CSS selector.

        Example:

        var elems = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");

        These are just a few examples of the many methods available in the DOM for selecting and accessing HTML
        elements. By using these methods, you can write JavaScript code to dynamically modify the content, style, and
        structure of web pages.</p>

    <h1>৩) What is event bubble?</h1>

    <p>Event bubbling is a phenomenon in the Document Object Model (DOM) where an event that is triggered on a child
        element "bubbles up" through its parent and ancestor elements until it reaches the document object.

        When an event is triggered on a child element, such as a click event on a button, the event is first handled by
        the child element. After the child element has finished handling the event, the event is then passed on to the
        parent element, which can also handle the event. If the parent element has an event listener for the event, it
        will be executed, and the event will continue to bubble up to the next ancestor element in the DOM tree until it
        reaches the top-level document object.</p>

    <h1>৪) What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is
        executed after some operation or event has been completed. The function that receives the callback function as
        an argument is responsible for calling the callback function after it has finished its task.

        The primary use case for a callback function is to perform some action or handle a result after an asynchronous
        operation has completed, such as making an AJAX request or waiting for a user input. Since JavaScript is a
        single-threaded language, using callbacks allows for non-blocking code execution, where the program can continue
        to execute other code while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

        Using a callback function can also help to write more modular and reusable code. By separating the code that
        initiates an operation from the code that handles its result, you can create functions that can be reused in
        different contexts and with different callback functions. This can make your code more flexible and easier to
        maintain.</p>
